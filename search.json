    "text": "Justification by the Jury\n\nLennart Wittkuhn has developed a modern and well-thought-out teaching concept for the seminar “Track, organize, and share your work: An introduction to Git for research”, which provides students with important skills for working with digital research data. The focus is on version control with Git and the promotion of reproducible scientific practices. The students work on a hands-on project - the development of a versioned online cookbook - and learn essential techniques for data organization and code management in a playful way. Particularly noteworthy are the impressively detailed and very structured, as well as publicly accessible, online teaching materials, including a specially developed textbook and interactive exercises, which allow participants to engage in flexible and self-directed learning. These materials, the motivation and competence of the instructor, and the inclusive and supportive atmosphere in the seminar were all highly praised by the participants."

    "text": "Description\n\nContent\nIn today’s digital age, the majority of scientific insights in research are gained from the analysis of data using programming code. Although data and code are integral parts of their work, scientists often handle digital objects on their computers in a somewhat chaotic, unreliable, and irreproducible manner. It’s not uncommon to hear researchers wondering, “Which version of my data and code did I use to get this result?” or “I found a bug in my code. Since when was it there?” and “This code used to work! What did I change?”. This not only affects the reproducibility and trustworthiness of science but also frequently leads to frustration, a waste of time, and, at worst, the loss of painstakingly accumulated work. The good news is that scientists can learn about practices and tools from other disciplines, particularly software engineering, that have significantly professionalized collaborative work on digital objects like programming code. At the core of this toolkit is the free and open-source software Git, a so-called version control system that allows tracking and organizing the evolution of digital objects on computers and sharing them via platforms like GitHub. In this hands-on course with practical exercises, participants will learn how to track, organize and share their work using Git.\n\n\nGoals\nThe primary aim of this course is to empower course participants with the skills to efficiently organize projects on their computers using Git and GitHub. Participants will actively engage in hands-on experiences with these tools, exploring both the command-line and Graphical User Interfaces. Proficiency in Git and GitHub not only enhances participants’ effectiveness in conducting research projects by ensuring organized and reproducible workflows but also elevates their employability. The technical skills acquired in this course are increasingly sought after in various work settings, providing course participants with a competitive edge in today’s dynamic job market.\n\n\nMechanics\nGuided by the seminar instructor, participants will engage in practical hands-on exercises with Git and GitHub while working through a dedicated Git Handbook (https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/) that is tuned to the structure of the course and needs of the course participants."

    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nThe digital objects on our computers are in a constant state of flux. Manuscripts, programming code and research data are changed continuously over long periods of time, often in close collaboration with others. A systematic documentation of these changes forms the basis for controlled and reproducible work on code and data. In a seminar with hands-on exercises, course participants will learn “Effective Progress Tracking and Collaboration: An Introduction to Version Control of Code and Data”.\nVersion control is the notebook for a digital world and Git is probably the best known version control system. Git allows to precisely document changes in digital objects and thus to track who changed what, when, how and why in a file. Changes can be revised, versions can be compared and restored. In addition, it is possible to work simultaneously on the same file and systematically integrate parallel versions. In addition, Git enables effective collaboration. Via platforms such as GitHub or GitLab, code and data can be shared with the world, transparently viewed by others, used and collaboratively developed. In this way, version control helps to ensure that knowledge generated from data is transparent, accessible and verifiable. As an effective method for storing and manipulating code and data, version control thus represents a core competency of data literacy.\nBecause Git was developed for versioning small, text-based files (such as programming code), its usability with larger, binary files (such as image or video data) is limited for technical reasons. The open-source software DataLad extends the features of Git to provide version control for large data sets (up to several terabytes). DataLad is applicable to arbitrary data structures and is independent of any central infrastructure or third-party vendors. Like Git, DataLad allows tracking changes to data and restoring previous versions of a data set. Furthermore, DataLad allows you to capture the digital provenance of data and accurately reproduce analyses of the data. In addition, DataLad allows to publish data on a variety of platforms or use existing data."

    "text": "Course Content\nIn today’s digital age, the majority of scientific insights in quantitative research are gained from the analysis of data using programming code. Although data and code are integral parts of their work, scientists often handle digital objects on their computers in a somewhat chaotic, unreliable, and irreproducible manner. It’s not uncommon to hear researchers wondering, “Which version of my data and code did I use to get this result?” or “I found a bug in my code. Since when was it there?” and “This code used to work! What did I change?”. This not only affects the reproducibility and trustworthiness of science but also frequently leads to frustration, a waste of time, and, at worst, the loss of painstakingly accumulated work. The good news is that scientists can learn about practices and tools from other disciplines, particularly software engineering, that have significantly professionalized collaborative work on digital objects like programming code. At the core of this toolkit is the free and open-source software Git, a so-called version control system that allows tracking and organizing the evolution of digital objects on computers and sharing them via platforms like GitHub. In this hands-on course with practical exercises, participants will learn how to track, organize and share their work using Git."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nNeural computations are often fast and anatomically localized. Yet, investigating such computations in humans is challenging because non-invasive methods have either high temporal or spatial resolution, but not both. Of particular relevance, fast neural replay is known to occur throughout the brain in a coordinated fashion about which little is known. We develop a multivariate analysis method for functional magnetic resonance imaging that makes it possible to study sequentially activated neural patterns separated by less than 100 ms with precise spatial resolution. Human participants viewed five images individually and sequentially with speeds up to 32 ms between items. Probabilistic pattern classifiers were trained on activation patterns in visual and ventrotemporal cortex during individual image trials. Applied to sequence trials, probabilistic classifier time courses allow the detection of neural representations and their order. Order detection remains possible at speeds up to 32 ms between items (plus 100 ms per item). The frequency spectrum of the sequentiality metric distinguishes between sub- versus supra-second sequences. Importantly, applied to resting-state data our method reveals fast replay of task-related stimuli in visual cortex. This indicates that non-hippocampal replay occurs even after tasks without memory requirements and shows that our method can be used to detect such spontaneously occurring replay."

It complements the file service UHHDisk and the Central Storage Infrastructure ZSI to meet the constantly growing demand for storage space for data from science and research.\n\n\nThe LZS is suitable for, among others, the following purposes:\n\n\nBackend for file services\nBackend for archiving solutions\nBackend for research data management or CMS\nBackend for the delivery of multimedia files\nStorage of measurement data or results from simulation calculations\nStorage of larger collections of photos, films or digitized books\nOn-premise cloud storage for scientific collaborations as a secure and affordable alternative to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)\n\n\nThe target group of the LZS are systems that speak S3 natively and have to store larger amounts of data at a low rate of data change. With UHHDisk, the RRZ offers a suitable platform for storing files, e.g. for home drives or project directories.\n\n\nDue to the system architecture and configuration, the LZS is not suitable for use in structured data (backend for databases) or virtualization environments. For this the RRZ offers a suitable service with the central storage infrastructure (ZSI).\n\n\nFor further questions about the S3 object and long-term storage, please send an e-mail to the RRZ-ServiceLine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical details of the LSZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Storage System: Cloudian HyperStore Object Storage\nCloudian guarantees 99% compatibility to Amazon S3"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nAdaptive behavior in daily life often requires the ability to acquire and represent sequential contingencies between actions and the associated outcomes. Although accumulating evidence implicates the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in complex value-based learning and decision-making, direct evidence for involvements of this region in integrating information across sequential decision states is still scarce. Using a 3-stage deterministic Markov decision task, here we applied offline, inhibitory low-frequency 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dlPFC in young male adults (n = 31, mean age = 23.8 years, SD = 2.5 years) in a within-subject cross-over design to study the roles of this region in influencing value-based sequential decision-making. In two separate sessions, each participant received 1-Hz rTMS stimulation either over the left dlPFC or over the vertex. The results showed that transiently inhibiting the left dlPFC impaired choice accuracy, particularly in situations in which the acquisition of sequential transitions between decision states and temporally lagged action-outcome contingencies played a greater role. Estimating parameters of a diffusion model from behavioral choices, we found that the diffusion drift rate, which reflects the efficiency of information integration, was attenuated by the stimulation. Moreover, the effects of rTMS interacted with session: individuals who could not efficiently integrate information across sequential states in the first session due to disrupted dlPFC function also could not catch up in performance during the second session with those individuals who could learn sequential transitions with intact dlPFC function in the first session. Taken together, our findings suggest that the left dlPFC is crucially involved in the acquisition of complex sequential relations and in the potential of such learning."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nHumans can implicitly learn about multistep sequential relationships between events in the environment from their statistical co-occurrence. Theoretical work has suggested that neural replay is a candidate mechanism that aids such learning. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to test whether replay is related to implicit learning of higher-order sequential relationships. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling of response times revealed that participants acquired multistep transition knowledge in a manner consistent with gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model. Yet, half of participants did not report being aware of any sequential task structure, and most participants failed to provide meaningful transition probability ratings in a posttask test. Analyses of temporal dynamics of multivariate fMRI patterns during brief 10 s pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task indicated backward sequential replay of multistep sequences in visual cortical areas. Variations in model parameters between participants that captured response time patterns related to strength of neural replay. No corresponding relations between replay and measures of explicit awareness were found. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nWe investigated, using temporally delayed linear modelling (TDLM) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), whether items associated with an underlying graph structure are replayed during a post-learning resting state. In these same data, we have previously provided evidence for replay during on-line (non-rest) memory retrieval. Despite successful decoding of brain activity during a localizer task, and contrary to predictions, we did not detect evidence for replay during a post-learning resting state. To better understand this, we performed a hybrid simulation analysis in which we inserted synthetic replay events into a control resting state recorded prior to the actual experiment. This simulation revealed that replay detection using our current pipeline requires extremely high replay densities to reach significance (&gt;1 replay sequence per second, with “replay” defined as a sequence of reactivations within a certain time lag). Furthermore, when scaling the number of replay events with a behavioural measure we were unable to experimentally induce a strong correlation between sequenceness and this measure. We infer that even if replay was present at plausible rates in our resting state dataset we would lack statistical power to detect it with TDLM. We discuss ways for optimizing the analysis approach and how to find boundary conditions under which TDLM can be expected to detect replay successfully. We conclude that solving these methodological constraints is likely to be crucial to optimise measuring replay non-invasively using MEG in humans."

In parallel, machine learning research has found that experience replay can lead to substantial performance improvements in artificial agents. Together, these lines of research suggest that replay has a variety of computational benefits for decision-making and learning. Here, we provide an overview of putative computational functions of replay as suggested by machine learning and neuroscientific research. We show that replay can lead to faster learning, less forgetting, reorganization or augmentation of experiences, and support planning and generalization. In addition, we highlight the benefits of reactivating abstracted internal representations rather than veridical memories, and discuss how replay could provide a mechanism to build internal representations that improve learning and decision-making."

    "text": "Course Content\nIn today’s digital age, the majority of scientific insights in psychological research are gained from the analysis of data using programming code. Although data and code are integral parts of their work, scientists often handle digital objects on their computers in a somewhat chaotic, unreliable, and irreproducible manner. It’s not uncommon to hear researchers wondering, “Which version of my data and code did I use to get this result?” or “I found a bug in my code. Since when was it there?” and “This code used to work! What did I change?”. This not only affects the reproducibility and trustworthiness of science but also frequently leads to frustration, a waste of time, and, at worst, the loss of painstakingly accumulated work. The good news is that scientists can learn about practices and tools from other disciplines, particularly software engineering, that have significantly professionalized collaborative work on digital objects like programming code. At the core of this toolkit is the free and open-source software Git, a so-called version control system that allows tracking and organizing the evolution of digital objects on computers and sharing them via platforms like GitHub. In this hands-on course with practical exercises, participants will learn how to track, organize and share their work using Git."
